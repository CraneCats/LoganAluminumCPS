Logan Aluminum's Crane Positioning System Project Software

This project, sponsored by Logan Aluminum, is to create a crane positioning system to aid large overhead crane operators in placing aluminum sheet coils in proper positions on the storage racks. Logan Aluminum has had issues with this in the past and has caused both efficientcy and safety concerns. The system will provide visible feedback to the operators via marked LEDs based on measurements and analysis retreieved and conducted through several LIDAR sensors and an Arduino Leonardo respectfully. The GitHub page is to store and track iterations of the software to be implemented on the Arduino Microcontroller within our system.
